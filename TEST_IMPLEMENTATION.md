# Test Implementation Status

This document provides an overview of the current implementation status of our comprehensive test plan.

## Implemented Components

We have successfully implemented the initial components of our comprehensive testing plan:

1. **Core Test Infrastructure**
   - `pkg/testhelpers/output.go`: Utilities for capturing standard output and stderr
   - `pkg/testhelpers/mocks/auth.go`: Mock authentication client for testing auth package
   - `pkg/testhelpers/mocks/transfer.go`: Mock transfer client for testing transfer package
   - `pkg/testhelpers/integration.go`: Helper functions for integration tests

2. **Unit Tests**
   - `cmd/auth/token_test.go`: Tests for token validation
   - `cmd/auth/whoami_test.go`: Tests for the whoami command
   - `pkg/output/formatter_test.go`: Tests for output formatters
   - `pkg/output/formatter_csv_test.go`: Additional tests for CSV formatting
   - `pkg/config/client_test.go`: Tests for client configuration loading
   - `pkg/config/client_additional_test.go`: Additional config tests for environment variables

3. **Command Tests**
   - `cmd/auth/login_test.go`: Tests for the auth login command
   - `cmd/auth/logout_test.go`: Tests for the auth logout command
   - `cmd/auth/refresh_test.go`: Tests for the auth refresh command
   - `cmd/auth/identities_test.go`: Tests for the auth identities command
   - `cmd/auth/tokens_test.go`: Tests for the auth tokens command
   - `cmd/transfer/ls_test.go`: Tests for the transfer ls command
   - `cmd/transfer/mkdir_test.go`: Tests for the transfer mkdir command
   - `cmd/transfer/cp_test.go`: Tests for the transfer cp command
   - `cmd/transfer/rm_test.go`: Tests for the transfer rm command
   - `cmd/transfer/task_test.go`: Tests for the transfer task commands (list, show, cancel, wait)

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for running tests

## Current Coverage

| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| pkg/output | 70.5% | Good |
| pkg/config | 53.8% | Moderate |
| cmd/auth | 1.0% | Needs significant work |
| cmd/transfer | ~60% | Good - all commands have tests |

## Next Steps

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Fix failing tests in auth commands (login, refresh)
   - Fix tests for transfer commands that are failing (ls, mkdir, rm)
   - Continue improving overall test coverage and reliability

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete integration test implementations in `cmd/auth/auth_integration_test.go`
   - Complete integration test implementations in `cmd/transfer/transfer_integration_test.go`
   - Set up test credentials for CI environment

3. **Test Workflow Improvements**
   - Enable code coverage reporting in CI
   - Set up matrix testing for multiple Go versions
   - Implement coverage thresholds

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Unit Tests (In Progress)
- Target: Increase coverage to >50% for all packages
- Status: Achieved 70.5% for output and 53.8% for config, need to improve auth
- Focus on common code paths first, then edge cases and error handling

### Phase 2: Command Tests (In Progress)
- Target: Full coverage of command-line interface functionality
- Status: Completed tests for all transfer commands (ls, mkdir, cp, rm, task)
- Status: Implemented tests for some auth commands (whoami, tokens, logout)
- Next: Fix failing tests in auth login and refresh commands

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (Not Started)
- Target: End-to-end testing with actual Globus services
- Skeleton files exist but need implementation
- Requires test environment setup and credentials

### Phase 4: CI Integration (Started)
- Target: Automated testing on push/PR
- Status: Basic GitHub Actions workflow implemented
- Need to add code coverage reporting and requirements

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Fix failing tests in login and refresh commands
2. Update CI workflow with coverage reporting
3. Check updated coverage metrics for all packages
4. Implement integration tests for transfer and auth commands

## Testing Patterns Established

We have established the following testing patterns:

1. **Mocking Strategies**
   - For clients that are created inside command functions, use custom command implementations
   - For utilities like output formatting, use direct testing of functions

2. **Command Testing**
   - Use `testhelpers.CaptureOutput()` to capture stdout/stderr
   - Override command `RunE` function to inject mocks
   - Use custom implementations of commands for testing

3. **Token Handling**
   - Test token validation with both valid and expired tokens
   - Create test tokens with appropriate expiration times

4. **Config Testing**
   - Test loading configuration from environment variables
   - Test loading configuration from viper settings
   - Test fallback to default values
