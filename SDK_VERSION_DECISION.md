# SDK Version Decision: v3 vs v4 for Feature Parity

**Decision Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** ✅ DECIDED - Proceed with SDK v3.65.0-1
**Decision:** Option 2 - Implement services on v3, migrate to v4 later

---

## Executive Summary

We must decide whether to implement the 5 remaining services (Groups, Timers, Search, Flows, Compute) using:
- **SDK v3.65.0-1** (current, stable, no breaking changes), OR
- **SDK v4.1.0-2** (latest, modern architecture, requires migration)

**Recommendation:** **Migrate to SDK v4.1.0-2 first, then implement new services**

This is the optimal time to migrate because:
1. We're undertaking major development work anyway (~5.5 months)
2. V4 provides 100% Python SDK parity needed for full CLI parity
3. Doing it now avoids migrating both existing + new code later
4. Modern architecture (context-first, explicit scopes) aligns with Go best practices

---

## Current Codebase Statistics

| Metric | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Implementation files (non-test) | 14 | Auth + Transfer |
| SDK v3 imports | 24 | Across all cmd files |
| Total non-test lines | ~3,229 | Needs context.Context additions |
| Services implemented | 2/7 | Auth, Transfer |
| Services remaining | 5/7 | Groups, Timers, Search, Flows, Compute |

---

## Option 1: Continue with SDK v3.65.0-1

### Approach
Continue using v3.x SDK, implement all 5 services, then migrate to v4 later.

### Pros ✅
- **No breaking changes** - Current code continues working
- **Lower immediate risk** - Proven, stable SDK
- **Faster to start** - Begin implementing services immediately
- **Incremental approach** - Can migrate to v4 later when ready
- **Less refactoring upfront** - ~3,229 lines unchanged initially

### Cons ❌
- **Double work** - Will need to migrate 7 services to v4 eventually (not just 2)
- **Technical debt** - Building on older architecture
- **Not future-proof** - V3 is maintenance mode, v4 is the future
- **Missed improvements** - No context support, older error handling
- **Larger migration later** - ~15,000+ lines to migrate instead of ~3,229
- **Feature limitations** - May lack some v4-only SDK features

### Effort Estimate
- **Immediate:** 0 weeks (no migration)
- **Services:** 22 weeks (5 services implementation)
- **Future v4 migration:** 8-12 weeks (all 7 services)
- **Total:** ~30-34 weeks

---

## Option 2: Migrate to SDK v4.1.0-2 First ⭐ RECOMMENDED

### Approach
Migrate existing Auth/Transfer to v4, then implement remaining 5 services with v4 from the start.

### Pros ✅
- **Modern architecture** - Context-first design (Go best practice)
- **100% Python SDK parity** - Required for full CLI feature parity
- **Better error handling** - Structured errors with request IDs
- **Explicit scopes** - Better security posture
- **Single migration** - Migrate 2 services now, not 7 later
- **Future-proof** - Build on the current SDK architecture
- **Clean slate** - New services built right from day one
- **Smaller initial migration** - Only ~3,229 lines vs ~15,000+ later

### Cons ❌
- **Breaking changes** - Requires refactoring existing code
- **Higher upfront effort** - 2-3 weeks migration before new features
- **Testing overhead** - All existing tests need updates
- **Risk during migration** - Potential for regressions

### Effort Estimate
- **v4 Migration:** 2-3 weeks (migrate Auth/Transfer)
- **Services:** 22 weeks (5 services implementation on v4)
- **Future v4 migration:** 0 weeks (already done)
- **Total:** ~24-25 weeks

## Migration Scope: v3 → v4

### Required Changes for Existing Code

#### 1. Import Path Updates (Automated)
```go
// Before (v3)
import "github.com/scttfrdmn/globus-go-sdk/v3/auth"

// After (v4)
import "github.com/scttfrdmn/globus-go-sdk/v4/auth"
```

#### 2. Context.Context Parameters (Manual)
```go
// Before (v3)
func GetUserInfo() (*UserInfo, error) {
    client := auth.NewClient(config)
    return client.GetUserInfo()
}

// After (v4)
func GetUserInfo(ctx context.Context) (*UserInfo, error) {
    client, err := auth.NewClient(ctx, config)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return client.GetUserInfo(ctx)
}
```

#### 3. Config Struct (Manual)
```go
// Before (v3)
client := auth.NewClient(
    auth.WithClientID(clientID),
    auth.WithClientSecret(clientSecret),
)

// After (v4)
config := core.Config{
    ClientID:     clientID,
    ClientSecret: clientSecret,
    Scopes:       []string{"openid", "profile"},
}
client, err := auth.NewClient(ctx, config)
```

#### 4. Error Handling (Manual)
```go
// Before (v3)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("API error: %w", err)
}

// After (v4)
if err != nil {
    if apiErr, ok := err.(*core.APIError); ok {
        return fmt.Errorf("API error [%s] (status %d): %w",
            apiErr.RequestID, apiErr.StatusCode, err)
    }
    return fmt.Errorf("error: %w", err)
}
```

### Files Requiring Changes

| File Category | Count | Change Type |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Import statements | 24 | Automated find/replace |
| Client initialization | ~14 | Manual - config struct |
| API method calls | ~50-100 | Manual - add context.Context |
| Error handling | ~50-100 | Manual - use structured errors |
| Test files | ~20 | Manual - update mocks & fixtures |

### Migration Resources Available
- ✅ **V4 Migration Guide** in SDK repository
- ✅ **V4 Quick Start** with examples

## Detailed Analysis

### Why v4 Migration Now Makes Sense

#### 1. **Economies of Scale**
- Migrating 2 services now < Migrating 7 services later
- Current: ~3,229 lines to update
- Later: ~15,000+ lines to update (5x more work)

#### 2. **Natural Breakpoint**
- Just completed version alignment (v3.39.0-1)
- Starting major new development (5 services)
- Team knowledge is fresh from recent SDK update

#### 3. **SDK Maturity**
- V4.1.0-2 includes all services (Transfer, Search, Flows, Timers, Compute)
- Released October 25, 2025 (same day as v3.65.0-1)
- Both are "latest" - v4 is not experimental

#### 4. **Architectural Benefits**
```go
// v3: No cancellation support
client.ListEndpoints()

// v4: Proper Go patterns with context
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
defer cancel()
client.ListEndpoints(ctx)
```

This enables:
- Request cancellation
- Timeout handling
- Deadline propagation
- Tracing integration

#### 5. **Error Handling Quality**
```go
// v4 structured errors
if apiErr, ok := err.(*core.APIError); ok {
    log.Printf("Request ID: %s", apiErr.RequestID)  // For support tickets
    log.Printf("Status: %d", apiErr.StatusCode)     // For debugging
    log.Printf("Code: %s", apiErr.ErrorCode)        // For handling
}
```

### Why NOT to Stay on v3

#### 1. **Inevitable Migration**
- V3 is maintenance mode
- V4 is the current SDK architecture
- Every month we delay = more code to migrate

#### 2. **Compound Interest Problem**
```
Month 0 (now):     2 services × 1,614 lines = 3,229 lines to migrate
Month 6 (later):   7 services × ~2,200 lines = 15,400 lines to migrate
```
Migration cost grows ~4.7x if we wait.

#### 3. **Mixed Architecture**
If we implement new services on v3, we'll have:
- Auth/Transfer on v3 (migrated later)
- Groups/Timers/Search/Flows/Compute on v3 (also migrated later)

OR:
- Auth/Transfer on v4 (migrated now)
- Groups/Timers/Search/Flows/Compute on v4 (clean from start)

Second option is cleaner.
